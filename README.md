# Knights and kings of chess with C++

Knights and kings of chess with C++ is a project created by me which mainly focuses on the moves of knight and king moves. A description about this, is given below;
  Chess is a two players strategy game that consist of 64 square boxes arranged into 8x8 square grid. Each player of the chess game has 16 pieces consist of: 
A king, A queen, 2 bishops, 2 rocks, 2 knights (a.k.a. horses), and 8 pawns. Each piece has a different move, distinct from other. This code only revolves around the moves of a knght and king.
  king have a significant place in the chess game. The game revolves around the king. King can move only a one box on either left or right or either to top or bottom or either in the diagonals left a right. Simply can move at any place only one box. Knight (horse) moves in a "L" shape, just like first move two boxes and then can move either left or right. And can make "L" shape move on each four sides if possible.

Note: This project not apply the rules of chess-game, it's main focus is to implement the knowledge of arrays , functions and pointers. It is a cpp(c++) code, which mainly focuses on the implementation of pointers and arrays.

  Project's main objective was to make a chess like game in which only Knight and king functionality can be applied, the game doesn't gave the functionality of all chess pieces. In this at the start positions are restricted to be assign the positions that are attack free. As said above the rules re not applied, the knight can kill king by moving towards kill and if king is killed game is ended and similarly if any one of knight is killed the game is ended again. Another way to end game is by entering the desired option to finish the game. Reminding again that don't mix it with real chess game because no chess rules are followed. This focuses on the moves and implementation of arrays, functions and pointers in cpp(c++).
