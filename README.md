# Chess-Game

Chess game is a project created by me which mainly focuses on the moves of knight and king moves. A description about this, is given below;
  Chess is a two players strategy game that consist of 64 square boxes arranged into 8x8 square grid. Each player of the chess game has 16 pieces consist of: 
A king, A queen, 2 bishops, 2 rocks, 2 knights (a.k.a. horses), and 8 pawns. Each piece has a different move, distinct from other. This code only revolves around the moves of a knght and king.
  king have a significant place in the chess game. The game revolves around the king. King can move only a one box on either left or right or either to top or bottom or either in the diagonals left a right. Simply can move at any place only one box. Knight (horse) moves in a "L" shape, just like first move two boxes and then can move either left or right. And can make "L" shape move on each four sides if possible.
